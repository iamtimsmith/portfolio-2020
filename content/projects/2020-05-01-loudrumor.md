I led development on the LoudRumor site for [Design On Tap](https://www.designontap.com). We used Advanced Custom Fields to build out a data structure in the back-end using WordPress, then built a front-end in GatsbyJS. A module system was used for different sections on the site which meant that the front-end had to be very flexible.
