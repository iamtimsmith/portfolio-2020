My portfolio was originally built in 2016 using html, css, and jquery. I decided to rebuild it using newer technologies and decided to use [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) which leverages the [React](https://www.reactjs.org) javascript framework. I've also used [Bulma](https://www.bulma.io) for basic styles using the flexbox css capabilities.
