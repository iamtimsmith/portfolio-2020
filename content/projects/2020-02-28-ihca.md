As a member of the [Design On Tap](https://www.designontap.com) team, I led the development team in building the Indiana Healthcare Association website. We used WordPress for the back-end since the client was familiar with the platform. The front-end uses Bootstrap, SCSS, jQuery, and PHP for templating.
