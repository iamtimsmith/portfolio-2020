Kelsey Zwicker needed redesign that gave her site a more modern look. She wanted it to be fast since her original site took a while to load. I decided the best stack to use for this would would be a [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) back-end so she would have a great content editing experience and [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) to create a very fast front-end.
